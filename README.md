## 02-Advanced CSS: Personal Portfolio Creation 
# What this Module Was about:
In this module we put the advanced CSS Skills we learned to the test. This included interactibility with a site's visible end, as well as linking items to the site and spacing on the browser. This was a fun module as I got to create my site from scratch and add my own person touches.
